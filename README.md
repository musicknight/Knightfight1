# Knightfight1
My current video game project

Thanks for checking out my game!

The objective is to knock the other character off of the platform 3 times. if a player has higher damage that means they will be knocked back more. taking/dealing damage builds up ultimate chrage. when you see the message U:READY under your character's damage/lives, press ultimate for a strong attack that makes you immune!
