# Knightfight1


Thanks for checking out my game!

The objective is to knock the other character off of the platform 3 times (think smash). if a player has higher damage that means they will be knocked back more. taking/dealing damage builds up ultimate charge. when you see the message U:READY under your character's damage/lives, press ultimate for a strong attack that makes you immune!

Ultimate Attack: Y

zero - deals good damage with attack1, spacing with attack3, and knockback with attack2

attack1-z-saber combo - a 3 hit combo done by pressing attack1 3 times within a short amount of time. the first and second hits dont do very much knockback, and the third shoots out a projectile with decent knockback

attack2-z-saber smash: after a delay, slam your saber into the ground creating a shockwave that does heavy knockback/damage

attack3-rising slash: slash upwards and fly into the air

ultimate-z-saber vortex: jump in the air and spin rapidly, moving with the directional keys (W/S and I/K are up and down for player 1 and 2, respectively

ninja kirby - not very much knockback, but quick movement speed and mobility from attack2 can make up for this. counterstrike has relatively high knockback. 

attack1-shuriken toss: spin around and throw a shuriken that deals moderate damage

attack2-dashing strike: after a very brief windup, dash in the direction you are facing, dealing moderate damage to anyone in your path

attack3-counter strike: turn grey for a very brief period, becoming immune. if you successfully dodge an attack with this, vanish in a a cloud of smoke and appear behind your enemy and strike through them, dealing fairly high knockback and moderate damage

ultimate-way of the ninja: quickly dash across the stage with your blade in hand. if you strike your enemy, they are stuck in place as a flurry of slashes does massive damage to them, before they finally feel the impact. usually a guaranteed kill if it lands.

sans - relatively slow moving spells, but hit really hard. in turn, sans moves slowly but is harder to knock off the stage

attack1-bone drop: drop a bone on someones head, dealing pretty heavy damage/knockback

attack2-bone dash: make a small dash in the direction you are facing, hitting anyone at the end of it with a small bone, minor damage/knockback

attack3-gaster blaster: your right eye turns blue, after a delay, turn into a skull and blast a laser with huge knockack

ultimate-mega gaster blaster: become a huge skull that blasts a devastating laser that does massive damage but not much knockback

shovel knight - all around character, build up damage with attack1 and attack2, and finish it off with an attack3

attack1-flare wand: pull out your flare wand, shooting a small fireball that does a little damage/knockback

attack2-shovel bounce: (only usable when midair) point your shovel downward, bouncing off your opponent if you land on them

attack3-shovel smash: after a delay, whack anyone in front of you with a huge shovel, doing big damage/knockback

ultimate-requiem of shield knight: recieve assistance from shield knight as she barrages your opponent from all angles. usually a guaranteed kill, but possible to dodge your way out of.

cloud - seems kind of weak, thinking of ways to make him better. all of his moves do moderate damage and knockback but are pretty telegraphed and easy to dodge.
 
 attack1-blade beam: swing your sword and emit a beam projectile that does moderate damage
 
 attack2-braver: after a short delay, dash in a direction and swing your sword for moderate damage/knockback
 
 attack3-climhazzard: rise into the air before slamming your sword down onto your foes, dealing moderate damage and decent knockback

ultimate-omnislash: dash repeatedly at your enemy from one side of the screen. If one can't stay in the air for as long as possible, this is an easy kill.

goku - like ninja kirby, not very much knockback(outside of ult), if attack2 is used correctly he can be very powerful. attack3 racks up a lot of damage and while goku isnt immune to damage during it, he is immune to knockback.

attack1-focused kick: after a delay, dash with a kick that deals moderate damage/knockback

attack2-vanish: dissapear for a brief period, dodging all attacks

attack3-kamehameha: after a delay, blast your enemy with pure energy dealing high damage and low knockback

ultimate-super saiyan: become a super saiyan, granting flying(jump and up fly upwards, down flies downwards), and empowered attack1 and attack2! if played right, goku can get 1 or possibly 2 kills with this, but if played wrong can garner nothing.

ariel - another all-around character. rack up damage with attack1 and attack3 and use attack2 for the kill

attack1-bubble: fling a bouncing bubble that deals moderate damage/knockback

attack2-tail whip: after a brief delay, swing out your tail dealing pretty high knockback

attack3-flounder: call flounder from the side of the screen you are facing, if he reaches you, he bounces off and does more damage if he hits anyone

tidal wave: turn into a tidal wave and rush to the side of the stage. Usually a guaranteed kill if it lands.

gengar - similar to sans in that he is slow moving with telegraphed, punishing attacks. attack2 is pretty quick if you can get in range.

attack1-shadow ball: charge up a projectile attack. if you move, you store your charge, however, if you are hit while charging, you lose your charge. once fully charged, gengar will glow purple. at max charge, deals high damage/knockback

attack2-lick: lick anyone standing immediately in front of you, dealing a fair amount of damage/knockback

attack3-smog bomb: lob a bubble that will explode on impact with your opponent of the stage, deals decent damage/knockback

ultimate-dark onslaught: unleash an onslaught of shadow balls onto your helpless opponent. if your opponent is in the air, this is usually a kill, if not, it depends on their damage/proximity to the edge of the platform

attack3-soaring flame: propel yourself backwards and up by launching a fireball in the opposite direction. can only be used twice in a row without landing on the platform.

attack2-reaping slash: after a brief delay perform a short high knockback attack

attack3-dashing slash: dash foward and slightly into the air, if pressed twice in a row a second dash aimed downward will occur, does damage
